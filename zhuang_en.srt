1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
Wang Xiangzhai used to say

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,960
Zhan Zhuang (Post Standing) is the training of stupid kung fu

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,200
A smart person often fails in hurrying up

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,640
Modern science has certified this

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,759
Muscle memory requires 21 days

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,160
It takes 90 days to truly form an instinctive reaction

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,760
Those who complain that Zhang Zhuang has no result

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,320
Most of them failed as go fishing 3 days and dry net for 2 days, not persistent.

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,120
Isn't not to compare who can stand longer

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,359
It's the process of talking to your own body

11
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,359
When you let go of your mind

12
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:32,320
Treat each exercise as a journey of exploring the body

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,119
Naturally, you can surpass a big gap

14
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,960
between thinking it to be correct and being wrong once you do it

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,519
If you're interested in Zhan Zhuang

16
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:42,759
